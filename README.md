The idea is to make an add-on for a watch/any wearable  which when triggered on by a button, sends the time and location of the user to the nearest police station and a set of emergency contacts with the help of a GSM/ GPS module, asking for help.
The add-on unit will be controlled by a unit that comprises of the development board (eg: Arduino Uno) and the GSM/GPS module, which can be placed in the bag of the user. These two units can be connected via bluetooth.

A prototype was developed for this project which sent out a buzzer alarm, and an emergency message to a preset mobile phone when triggered by a button.
